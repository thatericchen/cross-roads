# CrossRoads

![pictures]

Mobile game where player controls a turtle character attempting to cross rivers and oil spill roads. Rivers are filled with boats of varying speeds and directions and oil spill roads consist of floating logs that the player must jump on. Movement is controlled with a virtual joystick and obstacles have full collision hitboxes. The goal of the game is to reach the sand tiles at the other end of the game map while navigating the environment.
